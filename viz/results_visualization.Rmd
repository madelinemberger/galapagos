##Summary

This script creates visualizations of a small life cycle assessment comparing using  chemical fertilizer as a nutrient source to an alternative, fish silage, in the Galapagos. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

#read in the data

results <- read_csv(here("/viz", "results_v1.csv")) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(impact_category = x1, fertilizer, fish_silage)

```

First graph will show the ones that seem to have the best comparison in the excel version.
